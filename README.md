0x1D.C- Binary trees
What is a binary tree
What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

Short description of each file/script:
+ 0-binary_tree_node.c: A function that creates a binary tree node.
+ 1-binary_tree_insert_left.c: A function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node.
+ 2-binary_tree_insert_right.c: A function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node.
+ 3-binary_tree_delete.c: A function that deletes an entire binary tree.
+ 4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c: A function that checks if a node is a leaf.
+ 5-binary_tree_is_root.c: A function that checks if a given node is a root.
+ 6-binary_tree_preorder.c: A function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal.
+ 7-binary_tree_inorder.c: A function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal.
+ 8-binary_tree_postorder.c: A function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal.
